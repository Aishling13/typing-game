# ⌨️ Typing Game

A browser-based typing game inspired by *The Typing of the Dead*, created as part of **Code First Girls’ Coding Kickstarter (JavaScript)** course.  

Players type words to score points. This project was a fun way to explore **React hooks**, **state management**, and **conditional rendering**, while improving my understanding of JavaScript event handling and game logic.  

**Tech Stack:** React, CSS

**Live Demo:** [Play Typing Game on Vercel](https://typing-game-two-dun.vercel.app/)

## Future Improvements:
- Add a timer to challenge the player
- Add a words-per-minute (WPM) counter to measure typing speed
- Change text colour to red for incorrectly typed words
- Add sound effects for feedback
- Introduce difficulty levels
- Add accessibility options (e.g. toggle sound or dark mode)
